# Online-Fraud-Payment-Detection
Online Frauds and malpractices have grown exponentially in the recent years and we should take corrective measures to secure our privacy. With the increasing popularity of online and digital payments, more companies seek to streamline digital payments and make them more user-friendly and customer-centric.
Hence, in such a case, the best suitable technology to be used is Artifical Intelligence and especially Machine Learning to train the given set of data to identify and segregate the data into "Fraudulent" and "Non-Fradulent" categories.
Fraud detection using machine learning enables faster responses and efficient transactions. The Machine Learning model follows the following algorithm:
1. Gathering the data
2. Importing the dataset and libraries
3. Dealing with missing values
4. Dividing the dataset into dependent and independent variables
5. Dealing with categorical values
6. Splitting the dataset into training and test set
7. Model Creation
